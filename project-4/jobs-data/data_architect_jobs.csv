LTD.,"GRANDE BUILDING, 8 COMMONWEALTH LANE 149555",Permanent,Information Technology,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesAbout the job Moneysmart is hiring a Data Team lead to help lead our team of eager data engineers and analysts. Together you and your team will work to build a stable and scalable data infrastructure that will be able to help the business to collect, process and store masses of raw information securely, accurately and efficiently. With all that information on hand, we’ll be looking to you to help us design and build amazing data products to improve user experiences on our Moneysmart sites as well as build up the business intelligence capabilities within our organization. We’re looking for someone who is experienced and has done similar work like this elsewhere before. You will be working closely with people from other departments like Product, Marketing and Strategy to help understand their needs and design solutions that will enable them to deliver on their goals. Examples of this could be:  Onboarding customer data from external systems so further analysis can be conducted on it and we can discover/better understand customer preferences and trends Building a recommendation engine that can recommend products based on user’s past choices, creating a more personalized and desirable experience Creating a near real time reporting platform so that the country managers can get information in a more timely manner to make decisions quickly  To be able to do all these, you’ll need to plan and manage the Data Team’s roadmap well and help prioritize the work that needs to be done so that we can see the awesome impact it could bring sooner rather than later. You will be expected to be technical as well. Being able to build data pipelines, write code and tune database queries will be a requirement since you’ll need to review and vet the work your team has done. The engineers will be looking to you to learn about best practices in building pipelines and running analysis, industry standards on data infrastructure and what clean, maintainable code looks like. The team currently writes most of their code in Python and SQL at the moment (we use R sometimes as well). But fluency in any other Big Data framework language will be highly welcome. Our data engineers and analysts are a smart and talented bunch but they will require leadership and direction from their lead (which is you), someone who has been through the many phases of what it takes to build and maintain a production level data infrastructure, has seen the pitfalls and can help show them the way. Besides providing technical expertise to the team, a core part of this role will be to help mentor and develop the members of your team (as well as other developers in our department) professionally, and work towards creating a conducive environment for developers to thrive, making Moneysmart an ideal place to work and grow your career. If you’re ready to take up the important mantle of become a Data Team Lead in Moneysmart’s Technology department, send us your resume now!
