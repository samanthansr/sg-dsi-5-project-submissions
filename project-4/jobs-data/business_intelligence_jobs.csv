Reporting of the role This role reports to the Senior Vice President of Xaxis APAC. 3 best things about the job:  Direct and immediate impact to business Extraordinary growth and learning opportunities within APAC and beyond Highly visible position with clients, agencies, and other industry leaders  Measures of success In three months:  Complete understanding of team responsibilities, areas of focus, and engagement across regional and local teams You will have a firm understanding of where Xaxis “data” resides, it’s value, and be able to access it with ease  In six months:  You will become confident in your capabilities and be able to independently support regional and local markets on their requests and problems You will provide input to regional leadership on strategic direction and areas of potential growth & development for the team  In 12 months:  You will become a confident team leader and regional spokesperson for marketing science and insights & analytics to other regional leads You will provide strategic guidance and direction to our client strategy team as it pertains to marketing science and the responsibilities described in this job description  Overview and Responsibilities of the role: The role of Director of Marketing Science will, put simply, ‘make data happen’ for Xaxis APAC – and is a key role given the growth of data-driven marketing, and the key opportunity for programmatic media in this space. The role will involve a combination of “building” our capabilities in the area of data, insights & analytics – to be applied across all countries, teams and clients in APAC – together with directly “executing” these capabilities across our key regional clients. As with data and it’s broad application across the business, the role will have the opportunity to work closely with a passionate and senior team of experts in programmatic advertising – experts in the areas of client strategy, supply, platforms and technology, product development and so on. While you will be data ‘smart’ and analytically-minded, you will become even more so, and you will inspire and guide others to do the same. You know a lot, but you don’t know everything, and you’re happy to admit it. You fill this gap through questions, seeking learning opportunities (formal and informal), and aligning with smart people. The Director of Marketing Science will play a critical role in supporting the success of Xaxis, by leading with a strategic, data-driven, and performance-focussed mind-set. ‘Strategic’ in the sense that you can generate different options, and make decisions that drive best long-term value for Xaxis.  The pros and cons may not be obvious. The small things can make a big difference. The quickest solutions might not be the best. It might take many small steps to get the outcome we ultimately want. ‘Data-driven’, in that you use data for informing everyday decisions (internally), and apply widely to client and campaign solutions (externally). ‘Performance-focussed’ in that you know internal stakeholder, client and agency expectations, and you focus on delivering to these. And you know what makes sense, and what doesn’t, and how to influence. This role will have a broad remit to make best possible use of all available forms of data to improve campaign performance, increase profitability and revenue, and ultimately the value that Xaxis delivers to clients. Of course, the challenge is taking this data and turning it into meaningful insights that can be acted upon in a timely way.
